// Modal is another word for Dialogue Box!
// This "modalContent.js" file will contain the dialogue that will appear in the modal, once the button is clicked.

const modalContent = `<ol>
<p>Let's... </p>
<li>Make a "X" button that closes this textbox</li>
<li>How on earth have my group created this cake timeline?!?!</li>
<li>The 1st part of the 1st task in React Session 5</li>
<li>JS - session 7, from p.19... i.e. if inside while & filter & map... (see Trial_Affirmations JS file)</li>
<li>How to implement responsive sizing of this red element</li>
<li>How functions/ parameters work</li>
<li>Literally everything React! i.e. session1 (what are the elements doing?) and session2 (where is the button)</li>
</ol>`;
